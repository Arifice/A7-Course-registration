## FAQ

#### Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

Answer :

In this project I have used five UseState and one UseEffect Hooks . First  UseState Hook variable is initilized as an emty array . this  UseState hook returns an array of  fetch data from server by UseEffect hooks. this data are shown an card view on Course Component.

Second UseState hook returns an array of  selected Course handeling by Select Button 
third ,fourth and fifth UseState hooks return a number value handeling by select button .
This information are passed by props to the cart component and cart component  is used to dispaly.
